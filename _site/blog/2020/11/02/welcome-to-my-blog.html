<p>Hey! After many months of time pass, I have been finally able to create a blogging website with jekyll theme.
This is my first post. There may be many changes to this website in futures.
Thank you.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span> 
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span> 
    <span class="k">end</span> <span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span> 
    <span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT. </span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk.</p>
